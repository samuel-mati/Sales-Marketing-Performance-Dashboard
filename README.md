# Executive Sales & Performance Dashboard  

![Executive Overview](screenshots/executive.png)

## Executive Summary

The company faced a challenge: despite growing sales, executives lacked visibility into which regions, products, and customer segments were driving revenue and profitability. This limited their ability to allocate marketing budgets effectively and optimize product performance.  

To address this, I built a **Power BI dashboard** consolidating multi-regional retail sales data. The dashboard provides a **unified view of performance metrics**, highlights growth opportunities, and uncovers customer behavior patterns.  

**Key outcomes achieved:**  
- **Total Sales:** 10.1M (+28.7% YoY)  
- **Customer Base:** 500 (+53.8% YoY)  
- **Sales per Customer:** 20.2K (identified retention gap)  
- **Average Order Value:** 14.83K (stabilized pricing insights)  

The dashboard enabled leadership to prioritize high-performing regions, optimize product portfolios, and design retention-driven marketing strategies. **Next steps** include integrating marketing ROI tracking, predictive forecasting, and A/B testing on pricing in underperforming regions.


## Business Problem

The company operates across **four regions** with multiple store locations and diverse product lines.  
Despite overall sales growth, leadership lacked visibility into:

- Which regions were most profitable  
- Where performance was stagnating  
- How customer behavior and order patterns were shifting  

This lack of insight limited their ability to **make data-driven decisions**, allocate resources efficiently, and optimize product and regional strategies.  
The dashboard was created to provide a **unified view of performance metrics**, enabling executives to move from *guesswork to strategic action*.

## Methodology

To address the business problem, the following approach was applied using Power BI:

1. **Data Preparation & Modeling**  
   - Imported and cleaned multi-regional retail sales data using **Power Query**.  
   - Created relationships between tables to enable accurate analysis across regions, products, and customers.

2. **KPI & Metric Development**  
   - Developed key business metrics such as **Total Sales, Average Order Value, Customer Count, and YoY Growth** using **DAX measures**.  
   - Calculated insights like **profit margin, sales per customer, and month-over-month growth** directly in Power BI.

3. **Dashboard Design & Visualization**  
   - Built interactive visuals to track **regional and product performance**, sales trends, and customer behavior.  
   - Integrated **slicers and filters** to allow executives to drill down by region, category, and time period.

4. **Insight Generation**  
   - Interpreted the visualized data to provide actionable recommendations on **regional prioritization, product portfolio optimization, and customer retention strategies**.

**Skills Applied:** Power BI (data modeling, DAX, interactive dashboards, slicers & visuals), Analytical Thinking (trend detection, problem-solving), Business Interpretation (actionable insights from data).

## Results & Business Recommendations

**Key Findings:**
- **Total Sales:** 10.1M (+28.7% YoY) — strong overall growth, driven by Eastern and Central regions.  
- **Customer Base:** 500 (+53.8% YoY) — excellent acquisition, but **average sales per customer decreased**, indicating a retention or cross-sell gap.  
- **Regional Performance:** Eastern and Central regions are top performers; Coast and Western regions are underperforming.  
- **Product Performance:** Laptops and pens are top revenue drivers; low-margin SKUs like paper and chairs show declining traction.

2. **Regional Focus:** Prioritize marketing and sales investment in Eastern and Central regions; pilot promotions in Coast and Western regions.  
3. **Product Portfolio Optimization:** Promote high-margin products (e.g., laptops, tablets); reprice or bundle low-margin SKUs.  
4. **Seasonal Campaign Planning:** Address mid-year dips with targeted promotions or limited-time offers.  
5. **Data-Driven Monitoring:** Expand dashboard KPIs to include marketing ROI and customer segment performance for continuous improvement.

## Next Steps
